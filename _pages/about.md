I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University advised by [Prof. Niraj Jha](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/niraj-jha). Before this, I completed my undergraduate degree at The University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) in Computer Engineering (Honours) under [Prof. Salil Kanhere](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-salil-kanhere).

I am broadly interested in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and building bottom-up superintelligence. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, running and reading. Please feel free to get in touch via email if you want to collaborate or discuss any ideas!
