I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University advised by [Prof. Niraj Jha](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/niraj-jha). Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student at The University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) where I completed by Bachelors in Computer Engineering (Honours). I am broadly interested in improving the reasoning capabilities in LLMs and building bottom-up superintelligence. In my free time, I like to travel, hike, run and read. Feel free to get in touch via email if you want to collaborate or discuss any ideas!
